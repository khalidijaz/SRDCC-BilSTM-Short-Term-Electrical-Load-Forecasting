Download the ZIP folder from Github repository and extract it.
# For Jupter Notebook Files:
1. Place the extracted folder in the directory of Jupyter notebook.
2. After accessing the Jupyter interface, click on the extracted folder
3. After accessing the folder, five sub-folders will be found. The “Data” folder consists of Electrical Load Dataset.
4. Choose the desired "Multi-step DL Models" OR "Single-Step DL Models" to excute/run for forecasting purpose.
5. Choose the relevant algorithm's folder and open the FILES (.ipynb) present in that folder.
6. Run the program
7. Accuracy / Error results are also presented in Jupyter files.

# For MATLAB Files:
1. Open MATLAB program
2. Choose the desired model from "Machine Learning Models" OR "Statistical Models" to excute/run for forecasting purpose.
3. Choose the relevant algorithm's folder and open/import ALL the FILES (.m and .mat) present in that folder.
4. RUN the program
5. Accuracy / Error results of that algorithm will be displayed
